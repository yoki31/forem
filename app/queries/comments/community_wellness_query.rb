# This query will return an array of hashes that have the following structure:
# [
#   {
#     "user_id"=>11,
#     "serialized_weeks_ago"=>"0,1,16,20",
#     "serialized_comment_counts"=>"2,2,1,3"
#   },
#   ...
# ]
#
# Each result (hash) comes with `user_id` and the data required to check for the
# Community Wellness Badge. These limitations consist of users that have at
# least 2 comments without negative reactions (thumbsdown/vomit) per week.
#
# Note: Using `connection.execute("").to_a` instead of `.find_by_sql` because
# ActiveRecord doesn't populate any other fields that aren't included in the raw
# result set, so we don't get any added value from instantiating AR objects
