Hey <%= @user.name %>!

Thanks for volunteering to be a <%= community_name %> tag moderator. We‚Äôve added you as a moderator for <%= link_to "##{@tag}", tag_url(@tag) %>. Note that your profile picture is now visible on this page.

With great power comes great... you know the saying. As a tag moderator, you are able to:

- Remove #<%= @tag %> if it‚Äôs been added to an irrelevant post. Only remove tags when they do not fit well for the subject matter of the post. Do add more relevant tags if it will elevate the visibility of the post or make it discoverable to other audiences.
- Add #<%= @tag %> to posts if applicable. This helps the best content become more easily discoverable!
- Update the #<%= @tag %> tag landing page, including submission guidelines and design visible in the sidebar.
- Use the üßê on any posts that you think are breaking our Code of Conduct. Using this emoji on articles or comments will send them  to our team for review. There's no penalty for being wrong there; that's why we have a review step!
- Check to make sure that the experience level of the post is set and give it a rating if this field is not set.
- And lastly please use, üëç and üëé on the posts you enjoy and think are relevant; and on those posts that are not appropriate or lacking in quality. This helps the best content become more easily discoverable!
